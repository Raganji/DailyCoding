# PROJECT: Pull XLT info in via JSON using API (i.e. search the XLT database externally)
- First, set up the way to analyze the JSON results (pretty much done in 0209)
- Second, find a way to return custom text when the key ID doesn't exist (i.e. returns undefined)
- Third, find out how to pull in the JSON results via API
- Fourth, find out how to let the user (i.e. set variables) determine the API url (which data to pull)
- Fifth, find out how to input right side (string value) and return left side (key ID)
- Once these are done, the world is your oyster

# Fun projects to try
- Run RegEx expressions on inputted text (enter text, enter regex, spit out an output)
- Create a character limit for the inputted text box
- Get JSON result of an Excel file, conduct RegEx expressions on it
- Sort and order ux writing project list each month
- Create a trello card (any kind)
- Send something to slack (using API)
- Simple text replacer
