# PROJECT: Pull XLT info in via JSON using API (i.e. search the XLT database externally)
- First, set up the way to analyze the JSON results (pretty much done in 0209)
- Second, find a way to return custom text when the key ID doesn't exist (i.e. returns undefined)
- Third, find out how to pull in the JSON results via API
- Fourth, find out how to let the user (i.e. set variables) determine the API url (which data to pull)
- Fifth, find out how to input right side (string value) and return left side (key ID)
- Once these are done, the world is your oyster
- Copy the object (deep copy) and then delete parts of it (that don't match critera)
- First, if all fields are filled, confirm the object can be pulled in or else don't allow the user to proceed
- Once object is confirmed (i.e. data exists) then make buttons clickable (can also be reset)
- Display in table or allow download

# Fun projects to try
- Run RegEx expressions on inputted text (enter text, enter regex, spit out an output)
- Create a character limit for the inputted text box
- Get JSON result of an Excel file, conduct RegEx expressions on it
- Sort and order ux writing project list each month
- Create a trello card (any kind)
- Send something to slack (using API)
- Simple text replacer
- Line break determiner (accounts for spacing, select # of lines, sets balance)
- Enter once, send to Trello and Slack
- XTM key generator
- XTM API using thing
